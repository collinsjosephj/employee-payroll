# Employee Payroll Manager
This is a payroll manager that enables a manger to view and manage data. The goal is to have it run in browser and feature dynamic HTML &amp; CSS powered by JavaScript, and to be responsive to adapt to multiple screen sizes.  

## Key Points
-    The payroll manager wanted a payroll tracker to assist with employee data and budgeting 
-    When the payroll manager clicks on the 'Add Employee' button they are presented with a prompt for employee first name, last name, and salary information
-    When they are finished inputing data for that employee, they are prompted with whether they would like to add another employee
-    If they decide to continue, they can input first name, last name, and salary information for another employee
-    If they decide to cancel, employee data is displayed on the page sorted alphabetically by last name, and the console shows average salaries
-    One lucky employee will also win the drawing, which in this case, is a BRAND NEW car!
